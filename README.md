# Identification of cloncal hematopoiesis related mutations

This code is used for the analysis of mutations identified in the blood normal with genotypes in the tumor belonging to the same patient. It will generate a list of mutations that we call as clonal hematopoiesis (CH) mutations and clonal hematopoiesis presumptive drivers (CH-PD).
